                Here at Pizza Hub, we pride ourselves in using the freshest organic ingredients, from sustainable and net zero emission farms. 
                These factors cause our prices to be higher than the competition, but we make a zero-compromise pizza. Since we make a superior
                 product, we insist on being compensated accordingly. We offer many gracious specials and coupons to reduce prices for you.
                 If you still can’t afford the pizza, after coupons and rewards, then it’s safe to assume that our pizza would be wasted on you.
